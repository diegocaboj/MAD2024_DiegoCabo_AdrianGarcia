Description  
ParkFinder is an application focused on parking in Madrid. It features a map that shows parking locations and your current location. On this map, there is a button that tells you which parking lot is closest to you. ParkFinder also keeps a history of your locations and provides information about the parking lots, such as the street name where they are located, the price, the number of spaces, etc. It stands out from many other applications because you can use it without having to keep your location active, thanks to a feature that allows you to manually enter coordinates and a maximum distance. All the parking lots within that distance from the specified location will be displayed.
